# Android-Inventory-App
An app that keeps track of an inventory of items.
# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app was required to keep track of an inventory items. There had to be functionality for adding, removing, and changing the quantity of items. In addition, the app required a login screen and the capability to request permissions to send SMS notificcations.
# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
To satisfy the user's needs, a login screen, and inventory display screen, and a permissions screen were necessary. Different UI elements, such as Buttons, TextViews, and ConstraintLayouts were used to create the UI. The UI was designed to be simple and intuitive. By adhering to best practices, I was able to create a clean and easy to use user interface. 
# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
To create the app, I worked iteratively. I would focus on developing one feature at a time. After the feature was implemented, I would test it immediately to validate its functionality. The iterative process of programming can be utilized in any project by splitting the requirements up into discrete objectives and implementing one objective at a time.
# How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
I tested my code after a new feature was implemented. This involved using the Android logging library. It is important to test frequently, as it is easier to fix bugs when they are first discovered than much later into the development process.
# Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
Because developing Android apps was a new process for me, there were many challenges that I had to overcome. I had no previous experience creating Android apps, so I had to learn how to do many things, such as create an interactive UI, use a database in Android, and send SMS notifications.
# In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I feel that I was particularly successful in developing the UI for the app. I thought that my placement of UI elements was clean, logical, and visually pleasing.
